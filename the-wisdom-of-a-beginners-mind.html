            There is a seductive comfort in expertise. After years in any
            field‚Äîbe it your career, a relationship, or a creative pursuit‚Äîyou
            begin to map the terrain. You know the shortcuts, the pitfalls, the
            well-trodden paths that lead to acceptable outcomes. This map is
            incredibly valuable; it‚Äôs the sum of your hard-won experience. But
            it also becomes a cage, albeit a comfortable one. We stop looking at
            the landscape and start consulting the map. We cease to ask "what
            if?" and start declaring "what is." The curiosity that fueled our
            initial journey is replaced by the efficiency of the known route.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is why I keep returning to the Zen concept of Shoshin: the
            Beginner's Mind. It is not a mind that is empty or ignorant. On the
            contrary, it is a mind that is open, eager, and free from the
            preconceptions that expertise inevitably builds. A beginner looks at
            a problem and sees a universe of possibility. An expert looks at the
            same problem and sees the three standard solutions from the manual.
            The beginner isn't hampered by the knowledge of what "can't" be
            done. They are free to attempt the foolish, the unconventional, and
            in doing so, they sometimes stumble upon the brilliant.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've practiced this by deliberately placing myself in situations
            where I am a novice. I took a pottery class with no background in
            art. I tried to learn a new language in my 40s. The result was not a
            beautiful vase or fluency, but something far more valuable: a
            visceral reminder of what it feels like to not know. The
            frustration, the clumsiness, but also the tiny, exhilarating
            victories. That feeling is a potent antidote to the arrogance of
            expertise.
          </p>

          <p>
            So, I‚Äôve started applying this mindset to my familiar domains. I
            approach an old writing project and ask, "If I were just starting
            this today, with no attachment to the 10,000 words I've already
            written, how would I begin?" I look at a longstanding process in my
            life and wonder, "What assumption am I making here that a complete
            newcomer would immediately question?"
          </p>

          <p>
            The goal is not to discard your expertise, but to hold it more
            lightly. To wear your knowledge like a loose garment, not a suit of
            armor. The Beginner's Mind is a practice of intellectual humility.
            It is the conscious decision to set aside your map from time to time
            and walk the land again with fresh eyes. The paths you discover
            won't be in any guidebook. They will be your own, and they will lead
            to places your old map never knew existed.
          </p>

              <p>
                It occurred to me the other day that we spend most of our early
                lives being taught how to answer questions, and almost no time
                learning how to ask them.

              <p>
                Modernity has placed us in a state of perpetual,
                climate-controlled summer. Our food, our work, our entertainment
                are available in a constant, undifferentiated stream, 24/7/365.
                We have insulated ourselves from the most fundamental rhythm of
                the natural world: the cycle of the seasons.

                Our culture is infatuated with beginnings. We celebrate the new
                year, the new job, the new project, the clean slate. We have
                endless advice on how to start strong. But we are remarkably
                illiterate when it comes to endings. We let projects fizzle out
                from lack of interest.

              <p>
                We often think of our identity as a fixed, internal essence‚Äîa
                core self. But I've come to understand it as something more
                fluid and active: a collection of stories we tell ourselves,
                narratives we don like clothing every single day.
